# EATionary

## Description

 All of us cooked more during COVID peak and lockdown. Even though the restrictions are lifted and possible to eat at a restaurant, people miss cooking and eating healthy. 
This app could be a useful way to help use all the ingredients in the user’s fridge.
Hopefully, it'll help people use the food they have before it expires.
